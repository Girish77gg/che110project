        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>A hydropower plant, also known as a hydroelectric power plant, is a facility that harness the energy of moving water to generate electricity. It is a clean and renewable source of energy that is widely used around the world.</p>

    <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works?</h2>
        <p>The basic principle of a hydropower plant is to convert the kinetic energy of moving water into electrical energy. The process involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Water is diverted from a river or stream and directed into a penstock, which is a large pipe.</li>
            <li>The water flows through the penstock and down a steep drop, gaining speed and kinetic energy.</li>
            <li>The water strikes the blades of a turbine, causing it to spin.</li>
            <li>The rotation of the turbine is connected to a generator, which converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy.</li>
            <li>The electricity is then transmitted to homes and businesses.</li>
        </ol>

    <section id="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits of Hydropower Plants</h2>
        <p>Hydropower plants offer a number of benefits, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Renewable energy source: Hydropower is a renewable energy source, meaning it can be replenished naturally. This makes it a sustainable and environmentally friendly source of energy.</li>
            <li>Clean energy source: Hydropower plants do not produce any harmful emissions, making them a clean source of energy.</li>
            <li>Reliable energy source: Hydropower plants are a reliable source of energy, as they can operate continuously, regardless of weather conditions.</li>
            <li>Cost-effective energy source: Hydropower plants are relatively inexpensive to operate and maintain, making them a cost-effective source of energy.</li>
            <li>Multipurpose benefits: Hydropower plants can also provide other benefits, such as flood control, irrigation, and recreation.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="disadvantages">
        <h2>Disadvantages of Hydropower Plants</h2>
        <p>Despite their many benefits, hydropower plants also have some disadvantages, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Impact on ecosystems: The construction of dams can have a significant impact on local ecosystems, disrupting fish migration and altering habitats.</li>
            <li>Displacement of communities: The creation of reservoirs sometimes requires the displacement of communities, which can be a social and economic burden.</li>
            <li>Safety concerns: Dams can fail, causing catastrophic flooding and loss of life.</li>
            <li>Limited availability: Hydropower plants are limited to areas with suitable water resources.</li>
            <li>Environmental impacts of infrastructure: The construction of hydropower plants requires significant infrastructure, which can have negative environmental impacts.</li>
        </ul>
